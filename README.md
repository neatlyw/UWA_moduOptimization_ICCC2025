# UWA_moduOptimization_ICCC2025
The code for paper entitled "Data-Driven Modulation Optimization with LMMSE Equalization for Reliability Enhancement in Underwater Acoustic Communications"
1. run demo_channel.m in matlab to generate datasets (training and test)
2. run modem_learn_FullLMMSE_mse.py to carry out the training
3. run modem_save_ZP.py to save the modulation matrix F in our paper
4. run main_ber_fullLMMSE(_robust).m to test the performance
